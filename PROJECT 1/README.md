## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Summary

1. **Dataset Selection:**  
   Chose the official Medicare Hospital General Information dataset for its relevance and richness.

2. **Data Cleaning (Power Query):**
   - Removed unnecessary footnote columns.
   - Standardized categorical columns (ownership, EHR status).
   - Converted IDs, ZIP codes, and phone numbers to text for data integrity.
   - Replaced "Not Available" in ratings with nulls for proper numeric analysis.
   - Created a new `Ownership Category` column for simplified analysis.
   - Formatted names and locations for readability.

3. **Analysis & Visualization (Power BI):**
   - Answered five challenging business questions using DAX measures and interactive visuals.
   - Extracted key insights and visualized them with appropriate chart types.

## ‚ùì Business Questions & Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Which states have the highest and lowest average hospital overall ratings?**
- **Approach:**  
  DAX:  
  ```dax
  Average Rating = AVERAGE('HospInfo'[Hospital overall rating])
  ```
  Table visual with State and Average Rating.
- **Visualization:**  
  - Bar charts for Top 5 and Bottom 5 States.
  - **Titles:**  
    - Top 5 States by Average Hospital Overall Rating  
    - Bottom 5 States by Average Hospital Overall Rating
- **Insight:**  
  Significant variation exists; SD, DE, WI, MN, and ID lead, while NV, NY, PR, VI, and DC lag.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **How does average hospital rating differ by ownership category?**
- **Approach:**  
  Created `Ownership Category` in Power Query:
  ```powerquery
  if Text.Contains([Hospital Ownership], "Government") then "Government"
  else if Text.Contains([Hospital Ownership], "Volunteer non-profit") then "Voluntary non-profit"
  else [Hospital Ownership]
  ```
  DAX:  
  ```dax
  Average Rating = AVERAGE('HospInfo'[Hospital overall rating])
  ```
- **Visualization:**  
  Column chart  
  **Title:** Average Hospital Overall Rating by Ownership Category
- **Insight:**  
  Physician-owned hospitals have the highest ratings; tribal and proprietary hospitals rate lowest.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Is there a difference in average rating by EHR meaningful use status?**
- **Approach:**  
  DAX for status grouping:
  ```dax
  EHRs Status = 
  SWITCH(
      TRUE(),
      ISBLANK('HospInfo'[Meets criteria for meaningful use of EHRs]), "Unknown",
      'HospInfo'[Meets criteria for meaningful use of EHRs] = TRUE(), "True",
      'HospInfo'[Meets criteria for meaningful use of EHRs] = FALSE(), "False"
  )
  ```
- **Visualization:**  
  Pie chart  
  **Title:** Average Hospital Overall Rating by EHR Meaningful Use Status
- **Insight:**  
  Hospitals with unknown EHR status have slightly higher average ratings than those marked as True.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **How do hospital types compare in terms of average rating?**
- **Approach:**  
  Table visual with Hospital Type and Average Rating.
- **Visualization:**  
  Column chart  
  **Title:** Average Hospital Overall Rating by Hospital Type
- **Insight:**  
  Critical Access Hospitals outperform Acute Care Hospitals; Children‚Äôs Hospitals lack rating data.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Is there a relationship between hospital rating and mortality national comparison?**
- **Approach:**  
  Table visual with Mortality National Comparison and Average Rating.
- **Visualization:**  
  Column chart  
  **Title:** Average Hospital Overall Rating by Mortality National Comparison
- **Insight:**  
  Hospitals above the national average for mortality have higher ratings; those below have the lowest.
